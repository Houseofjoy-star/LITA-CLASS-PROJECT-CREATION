# Sales Overview
## Total Sales
- Visual Type: Card
- Measure: Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Quantity] * Sales[UnitPrice])
- Insight: Displays the overall sales value, providing a quick view of revenue performance.
- Design Tip: Position this card at the top for visibility. Use bold fonts and a large size to make it prominent.

## Average Order Value (AOV)
- Visual Type: Card
- Measure: AOV = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])
- Insight: Shows the average revenue per order, which is a key performance metric for sales.
- Design Tip: Position this alongside the Total Sales and Total Orders cards. Use a unique color to differentiate it as a calculated metric.

 ## Sales Trends Over Time
### Monthly Sales Trend
- Visual Type: Line Chart
- Axis Setup:
- X-axis: OrderDate (set to month/year format)
- Y-axis: Total Sales
- Insight: This line chart shows sales trends over time, helping you observe peaks and dips in sales.
- Design Tip: Enable data markers to clearly show each month’s data point. Include tooltips with exact sales numbers and order counts for more detailed insights.

## Powerbi Ans.
### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
- Create a Table: Ensure your data is formatted as a table in Excel for easy manipulation. Go to Insert > Table and select your data range.
- Add Calculated Columns: Add a Total Sales column using the formula =Quantity * UnitPrice if not already done.
- Convert Order Date to Month & Year Columns: This will make it easier to group data by month and year in PivotTables.
Use Excel formulas like =TEXT(OrderDate, "YYYY-MM") in a new column called OrderMonth.


### Step 2: Set Up the Dashboard Layout
- Create a new worksheet and name it Dashboard.
- Organize the layout with separate sections for the Sales Overview, Top-Performing Products, and Regional Breakdown.
- Leave space for charts and slicers for interactivity.

### Step 3: Sales Overview Section
A. Monthly Sales Trend Chart
- Create a PivotTable:
- Rows: OrderMonth (group by month and year).
- Values: Sum of Total Sales.
- Insert a line chart based on the PivotTable to show the monthly trend of total sales.
- Place the chart in the Sales Overview section and add titles, labels, and data points as needed.

## Example Dashboard Layout
Here’s a suggested layout for your Dashboard sheet:
- Section	Contents
- Sales Overview	Monthly Sales Trend Chart, Total Sales KPI
- Top-Performing Products	Bar Chart of Total Sales by Product
- Regional Breakdown	Pie Chart of Sales by Region
- Additional Insights	Top 5 Customers Chart, Year-over-Year Comparison Chart
- Slicers	Year, Region, Product slicers for filtering


## SQL Sales Data Analysis Report
### Overview
This report provides SQL queries for an initial exploration of sales data. The analysis focuses on calculating total sales by product, region, and month, as well as deriving additional metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region. These SQL queries can be used to quickly gather insights into the data for reporting and decision-making.
### Table Structure
### Assume we have a table called sales_data with the following structure:
- Column	Data Type	Description
- OrderID	INT	Unique identifier for each order
- CustomerId	VARCHAR	Unique identifier for each customer
- Product	VARCHAR	Product name (in this case, "Gloves")
- Region	VARCHAR	Region where the sale occurred (e.g., "East")
- OrderDate	DATE	Date when the order was placed
- Quantity	INT	Number of items ordered
- UnitPrice	SMALLINT	Price per unit of the product
  
## Goals of the Analysis
1.Summarize total sales (revenue) by product, region, and month.
2.Calculate average sales per product.
3.Determine total revenue by region.
4.Generate additional insights, such as identifying top customers and observing sales trends over time.

1. Calculate Total Sales (Revenue) for Each Order
First, we calculate total sales for each order using the Quantity and UnitPrice columns.
sql
Copy code
- SELECT 
    OrderID,
    CustomerId,
    Product,
    Region,
    OrderDate,
    Quantity,
    UnitPrice,
    (Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSalesFROM 
    sales_data;
   
3. Total Sales by Product, Region, and Month
To summarize total sales by product, region, and month, we use the following query. This query groups by Product, Region, and the month extracted from OrderDate.
sql
Copy code
- SELECT 
    Product,
    Region,
    DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS OrderMonth,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSalesFROM 
    sales_dataGROUP BY 
    Product,
    Region,
    DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m')ORDER BY 
    OrderMonth;

- This query provides a monthly breakdown of total sales for each product and region. It can be expanded if additional products or regions are present in the data.
4. Average Sales per Product
To calculate the average sales per product, we can use the following query:
sql
Copy code
- SELECT 
    Product,
    AVG(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS AvgSalesFROM 
    sales_dataGROUP BY 
    Product;

- This query calculates the average revenue generated per product, giving a sense of the typical revenue contribution of each product.
5. Total Revenue by Region
To find the total revenue generated in each region, we can use this query:
sql
Copy code
- SELECT 
    Region,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalRevenueFROM 
    sales_dataGROUP BY 
    Region;
In this dataset, since only the "East" region is present, this query will provide the total revenue for the East region. If additional regions are added,
this query will display revenue totals by region.

7. Additional Analysis
- Monthly Sales Trends
To view monthly sales trends over the year, use the following query, which groups data by month and year. This can help identify patterns in monthly sales.
sql
Copy code
- SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m') AS OrderMonth,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSalesFROM 
    sales_dataGROUP BY 
    DATE_FORMAT(OrderDate, '%Y-%m')ORDER BY 
    OrderMonth;
This query provides a time series of total sales by month, which can be visualized as a line chart to observe seasonal patterns.
Top 5 Customers by Sales

- To identify the top 5 customers based on total revenue, use this query:
sql
Copy code
- SELECT 
    CustomerId,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSalesFROM 
    sales_dataGROUP BY 
    CustomerIdORDER BY 
    TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 5;

- This query ranks customers by total sales, allowing us to see which customers contribute most to revenue.
Year-over-Year Comparison
 For a year-over-year comparison of monthly sales, use this query to get monthly sales grouped by year:
- SELECT 
    YEAR(OrderDate) AS Year,
    MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month,
    SUM(Quantity * UnitPrice) AS TotalSalesFROM 
    sales_dataGROUP BY 
    YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)ORDER BY 
    Year, Month;
This query allows you to analyze how sales perform in each month across different years, which is useful for identifying growth trends or seasonal variations.

### Summary of Key Insights
- Total Sales by Product and Region: This analysis shows monthly variations in total sales.
- Average Sales per Product: Calculates the average revenue per product, allowing us to understand typical order value.
- Top Customers: Identifies the top 5 customers by revenue, useful for targeted customer retention efforts.
- Monthly and Yearly Trends: Shows sales patterns across months and compares monthly sales over different years to spot seasonal patterns.
