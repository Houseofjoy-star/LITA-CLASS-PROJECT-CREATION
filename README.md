# Sales Overview

- Design Tip: Position this card at the top for visibility. Use bold fonts and a large size to make it prominent.

## Average Order Value (AOV)
- Visual Type: Card
- Measure: AOV = DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders])
- Insight: Shows the average revenue per order, which is a key performance metric for sales.
- Design Tip: Position this alongside the Total Sales and Total Orders cards. Use a unique color to differentiate it as a calculated metric.

- Axis Setup:
- X-axis: OrderDate (set to month/year format)
